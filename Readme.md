ColladaFileViewer
=================

The JavaScript code in this repository partially implements a rudimentary
Collada file viewer.  To see it in action, open the file
Source/ColladaFileViewer.html in a web browser that runs JavaScript,
then specify a Collada file to display.

A Collada file encodes a scene composed of three-dimensional models.
Its standard file extension is .dae.

A sample .dae file, generated from the default single-cube scene in
Blender3D, is provided in the Samples directory.  This program will
successfully open it and render it, though as of this writing, and for
unknown reasons, the cube looks a little misshapen.
